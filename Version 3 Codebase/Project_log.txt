Project Summary Report: Alpaca Options Scanner

Goal: To develop an automated scanner using Alpaca API to identify potential options trading opportunities based on market conditions (time window, volume spike, direction) and execute paper trades with calculated risk parameters.
Key Learnings from this Project:

    Alpaca API Client Evolution & Adaptation: We encountered and resolved issues related to the alpaca-py library's API surface changing (e.g., get_option_chains vs. get_option_contracts). This highlighted the importance of:
        API Documentation: Regularly consulting the official Alpaca alpaca-py documentation for the most up-to-date methods and object structures.
        Code Introspection: Using tools like dir() and inspect to examine available methods on objects (trading_client) during debugging.
        Version Management: Understanding how library versions can impact available functionality.

    Practical Options Data Retrieval: You gained hands-on experience fetching live options data, specifically focusing on At-The-Money (ATM) implied volatility (IV) as a proxy for IV percentile. This involved understanding:
        How to request option contracts for a specific symbol and expiration date.
        Filtering and processing options data to find contracts near the current stock price.
        Extracting and utilizing implied volatility figures.

    Algorithmic Trading Condition Design: We implemented logic for critical entry conditions:
        Time Gating: Restricting scanning to specific, high-liquidity market hours (e.g., 9:35-10:30 AM and 3:00-3:55 PM ET).
        Volume Spike Detection: Identifying abnormal increases in trading volume using a multiple of average historical volume.
        Price Direction Analysis: Determining whether a volume spike is accompanied by an upward (call) or downward (put) price movement over a short period.

    Basic Risk Management & Position Sizing: The project integrated fundamental risk management techniques:
        Average True Range (ATR): Calculating ATR to create dynamic, volatility-adjusted Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) levels.
        IV-Scaled Position Sizing: Adjusting the number of contracts based on implied volatility, aiming to reduce exposure during high IV environments (or increase during low IV if that's the strategy's goal).
        Fixed Risk Percentage: Maintaining a consistent risk per trade (e.g., 1% of account equity).

    Automated Scanning Loop Implementation: You built a robust scanning mechanism that:
        Executes the analysis and trade submission logic at regular intervals (e.g., every 60 seconds).
        Includes a heartbeat mechanism to keep the Colab environment active and prevent timeouts during long runs.

    Google Colaboratory Limitations: You learned about the practical constraints of using platforms like Colab for continuous, unattended operations, specifically the idle timeout issues, and explored workarounds while recognizing the need for more dedicated infrastructure for production-grade solutions.

Technologies & Concepts Utilized:

    Python Programming Language: The core language for the entire project.
    Alpaca alpaca-py Library: The primary interface for interacting with Alpaca's trading and market data APIs.
        TradingClient: Account management, options contract retrieval, order submission.
        StockHistoricalDataClient: Historical stock bar data.
        Data Request Objects (StockBarsRequest, GetOptionContractsRequest).
        Order Management Objects (MarketOrderRequest, OrderSide, TimeInForce).
    Data Science & Numerical Libraries:
        pandas: For handling and manipulating market data (DataFrames).
        numpy: For efficient numerical calculations (e.g., in ATR).
    Time & Date Handling:
        datetime (Python standard library): For current time, date, and time calculations.
        pytz: For handling timezones, specifically 'America/New_York' (ET) for market hours.
    Algorithmic Trading Concepts:
        Market data fetching and processing.
        Technical indicators (simplified ATR).
        Conditional logic for trade entry and exit.
        Paper trading for strategy validation.
    Google Colaboratory: The development environment for coding and execution.
